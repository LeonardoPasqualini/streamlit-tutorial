# Streamlit tutorial

This repository documents my progress and learnings as I work through the Streamlit tutorial. I'm following the tutorial available on [streamlit.io](https://docs.streamlit.io/get-started/tutorials/create-an-app).

In this repository, two diferent projects were created:
* Uber Pickups
    * The ideia of this project is to create a simple app that can show the diferent components on streamlit and how to use them.
* Multipage App
    * This project is focused on how to create a multipage app using streamlit. The ideia is to create a simple app that can transform the prior 1.10.0 Stremlit Hello page into a multi page app.
